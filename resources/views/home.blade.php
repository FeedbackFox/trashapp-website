                        Recycling is important to preserve the environment and to leave the planet in a better condition than we found it. Did you know that the average American throws away four pounds of trash daily? That is more than 1.5 tons of waste per person per year. Multiply that by 6 billion people and you know we have a major problem with waste.
                        <br><br>
                        For example, one of the biggest problems in the world today is the staggering amount of electronic waste (e-waste) that is produced. In 2009, thrown away TVs, computer, printers, monitors, scanners, keyboards etc. made up 2.37 million tons in the US.
                        <br><br>
                        This was only 2% of our landfill trash, but 70% of our toxic waste. It poisons our soil, water, trees and other precious resources. E-waste is especially bad for the environment and is something that kids can help to prevent as they learn to recycle many things in their communities: papers, magazines, cans, plastic and glass bottles, electronics and more.
                        <br><br>
                        The good news that all of us can do our part to recycle, and it starts the youth of America. If children learn from early on to recycle, they will carry that good habit with them for life. With some easy effort and guidelines, kids can learn how to become part of the solution to recycling for a healthier planet.
                        <br><br>
                        This guide will outline the key aspects of recycling, challenges, and what kids can do specifically to help to improve our recycling efforts every day. Use it as a resource to teach your students about the importance of becoming part of the recycling revolution.
